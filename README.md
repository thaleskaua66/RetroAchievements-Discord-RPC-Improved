## FORK INFO
This fork was made to fix two bugs on the file RARPC.py, one caused by the "type" not being found and the other one by the RPC description being over 128 characters.

# RetroAchievements Discord Presence: Improved
## Features:
- The game icon is displayed on the Discord's RP.
- The console currently being played is also displayed.
- Hovering over the game icon displays the user's overall achievements status about the current game. _(e.g "31 of 138 achieved | 22 %")_
- Displays the user's story progress percentage at the last part of the rich presence message about the current game. _(e.g "...some rich presence message | Story Progress: 48 %")_  
- A first button that redirects to the user's RA profile. _(Don't worry, I made an option to turn this off)_
- If the username display is turned off, the first button will have the link of the RetroAchievements website instead.
- A second button that redirects to the current game info inside the RetroAchievements website. 
- Discord's Rich Presence will get cleared after you stopped playing for 5 minutes (default). _(You can modify this duration inside the `config.ini` file)_
- Optimized game title.
- Optimized game status.

## Instructions (Running it as an Exe file)
_In this way, you **don't need to install** Python and its packages._
1. Run the `Discord RA Rich Presence.exe` file.
2. A `config.ini` file will be generated and your RA credentials will be put inside of it.
3. Modify the `config.ini` file if you need to adjust some default settings. _(Like the timeout limit, refresh rate, or even your entered credentials)_
_Note: Running it silently/in the background isn't allowed with the `exe` file. You need to follow the instructions below to implement it._

## Instructions (Running it as a Python file)
1. Install Python. _(It works currently at version 3.13.1)_
2. Run `cmd` and ensure that python is installed correctly by entering this command `py --version`.
3. Run the command, `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`. Make sure that you're running this command in this directory.
4. Open Discord App. (_NOTE: Discord App should always be opened first before running the `run.bat` file._)
5. Go to Discord > User Settings > Activity Privacy. Toggle on `Share your detected activity with others.`
6. Run the `run.bat` file, enter your credentials, `username` and `api key` from RetroAchievements.

Note: You may alternatively store your credentials via environment variables `RETROACHIEVEMENTS_USERNAME` and `RETROACHIEVEMENTS_API_KEY`. If set, they will be used by default.

After running the `run.bat` file, a `config.ini` file will be created in the same directory. The credentials that you've submitted are stored in this config file.

### If you want to run the batch file in the background:
1. Run the `batRunner.vbs` file instead of the `run.bat`. _(You can only do this once you've configured your credentials and your rich presence works already.)_ Otherwise, run your `run.bat` file. 
2. Since running the `batRunner.vbs` file makes the process not visible on the taskbar, you need to run the `batStopper.bat` to stop the rich presence from working. _(Otherwise, the other way is to stop `Python` from running on your task manager)_
3. It is also possible to make the `batRunner.vbs` file to run as startup app.<br>
   Make a shortcut of the file > Windows + R > Type `shell:startup`, then press Enter > Place the shortcut in this directory.<br><br>
If you want to keep the rich presence running, you can just edit the `config.ini` file and modify the `keepRunning` value. By default, it is set to `False`. Turn this to `True` if you want to keep it running without idling.

### How to turn off username display?
1. If ever you don't want your username to have a redirection button on your Discord RP, just edit the `config.ini` file and modify the value inside the `displayUsername` to `False`. By default, this is `True`. _Notice the capital letters in the True and False as wrong cases may result to an error._
2. Save the changes you made, close the `run.bat` file, and open it again to reflect changes.
3. If you're using the `exe` file, just refer to step 2 and do the same thing. 

All the configurations inside the `config.ini` file can be modified based on your preferences. Just make sure to follow the proper syntax to avoid errors. 

### Things to keep in mind:
- Always open the Discord App first before running the script or the exe file.
- Restart the Rich Presence from running when switching accounts or reopening the Discord App.
